Perl library for controlling UAVs, specifically ARDrone (maybe others in the future).  See:

http://ardrone2.parrot.com

WARNING! THIS IS PRE-ALPHA CODE!
This has not yet been tested on an actual ARDrone, since I haven't gotten one yet.  The 
code and tests here are according to my understanding of the developer docs.  If your 
ARDrone crashes into your neighbor's house, invades Iranian airspace, or tries to 
find Sarah Conner, don't blame me.
