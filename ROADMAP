Version 0.8
-----------
* WumpusRover Client
    * wumpus library under share/
    * Send min/max radio settings packets
    * Test share/WumpusRover in bin/uav
* Modify uav_joystick (and other bin/uav_*) to use share/ libraries
* Use Devel::CheckLib to look for ffmpeg 
    * Replace Alien::ffmpeg?
* Fix WumpusRover packet parsing for when the data we have is longer than a 
  single packet
    * Only process as much data as we need
* Document
    * UAV::Pilot::Command (changes in driver/control handling)
    * UAV::Pilot::ControlHelicopter
    * UAV::Pilot::ControlRover
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Driver
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::PacketFactory
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Packet
    * UAV::Pilot::Server
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Server (why we map values at this level)
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Server::Backend
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Control
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover::Server::Backend::RaspberryPiI2C
    * UAV::Pilot::WumpusRover


Version 0.9
-----------
* For bin/uav;
    * Different libraries will need to be loaded with a different host
    * Use a factory pattern for init'ing the drivers and controllers
* UAV::Pilot::SDL::WindowEventHandlers should be handed an SDL::Surface 
  to draw on
* SDL2 w/Streaming pixels for video?  Or OpenGL?
    * Navigation overlay on top of video
    * Get the color right on top of the UAV::Pilot::SDL::VideoOverlay
* UAV::SDL::Video (xs) -- Use sws_getCachedContext() instead of sws_getContext()
* Error message formatting in REPL
* EasyEvent takes nav data into account ("vert_speed 1.0 until altitude == 10000cm")
* Possibly use subref in @INC to load REPL modules.  See require() perlfunc docs in 
  Perl 5.19.2.  Note that feature was implemented in 5.10 according to 5.19.2's perldelta.
* bin/uav uses a Factory object to create the Driver and Control objects
* bin/uav loads a config file for loading modules by default
* Build script checks for ffmpeg being installed

Version ???
-----------
* Send multiconfig commands in order to set video display size and fps
